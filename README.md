# System Design

System Design is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets the end-user requirements. 

## Importance of System Design

System design is important for anyone who wants to build a robust, scalable, and efficient software application. 

* **Scalability and Reliability:** Ensures systems can grow without failure.
* **Efficient Resource Management:** Optimizes resource allocation.
* **Adaptability:** Allows systems to evolve with business needs.

## Core Components

### HLD (High Level Design)
**Initial step** in the development of applications where the overall structure of a system is planned.



# Monolithic Architecture - System Design
Monolithic architecture is a software design methodology that combines all of an application's components into a single, inseparable unit. Under this architecture, the user interface, business logic, and data access layers are all created, put into use, and maintained as one, unified unit.

A traditional approach in system design, which contains all application components into a single codebase.
It was preferred for its simplicity and ease of initial setup.
In contrast, alternative architectural approaches, like microservices, divide the application into smaller, separately deployable services.
Because of its rigidity, it is difficult to scale and maintain, which makes it difficult to adjust to changing needs.

## Importance of Monolithic Systems
Single Codebase: All components are developed and maintained in one codebase, simplifying management.






## What is server?
-> Where we host our site or deploy our projects.
-> Server has its own IP Address

## DNS ![Uploading image.png…]()

-> The Domain Name System (DNS) is often referred to as the "phonebook of the Internet". 
-> It is a hierarchical, distributed database that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into numerical IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network. 
-> Allows humans to use memorable names to access websites instead of memorizing complex numeric IP addresses.
