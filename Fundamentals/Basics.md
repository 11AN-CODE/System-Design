# System Design

System Design is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets the end-user requirements.

-> The Domain Name System (DNS) is often referred to as the "phonebook of the Internet". 
<br>
-> It is a hierarchical, distributed database that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into numerical IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network. 
<br>
-> Allows humans to use memorable names to access websites instead of memorizing complex numeric IP addresses.
